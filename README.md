Task[In] is a simple applilcation to manage projects and task and also use Pomodoro Technic work on them. Â¡Just that you need to be a little more productive!.

Task[in] is a project to show how we can develop applications (mainly in Microsoft .NET using C#). Task[in] include, samples, startup guides, best practices and others recomendations. All of them from my point of view and according to my professional experience. It's a step by step, about how we can develop real applications and not just thinking in samples or PoCs.

Task[in] Book, is a spanish book I started to write to include all of these practices and geeks adventures in order to guide or to do all develops things easier. Here we have a question, Why in each our project we start again and again? I think Windows Template Studio ([WindowsTemplateStudio]) and ([Template10]) are good example of this for UWP.

Targets:
- RESTfull Api
- Project Templates and reuse them in more projecrts
- Azure App Services
- SQL Azure
- Azure Storage Account 
- Azure Mobile Services
- UWP
- MVVM
- And much more ...
